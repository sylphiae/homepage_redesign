Democracy is America's operating system. If it doesn't work, nothing else will. Through a series of court decisions and a steady weakening of campaign finance laws that's given us things like Super PACs, big money has exposed a major vulnerability in American democracy, which has allowed a steady stream of threats and challenges to a free and open internet. These threats aren't isolated. They are systemic. They are a natural outcome of a root problem: the money problem.

The failure of issues like net neutrality, patent reform, and the protection of online privacy are all direct results of big money influences in politics. And these issues are just the start -- if we don't act NOW.

MAYDAY is a crowdfunded, kickstarted Super PAC to end Super PACs. Help us reach our goal of $5 million by July 4th so that we can declare independence from our broken, corrupt campaign finance system. We only keep the money if we hit our goal. If we don’t you get your money back. If we do, we get our democracy back.
