# How should we fight?

MAYDAY is a crowdfunded, kickstarted Super PAC to end all Super PACs. We want to fight fire with fire, but we also want to bring a different kind of flame to the fight -- we won't win with money alone.
 
We need you to tell us: what campaign tools and tactics should we emphasize in this fight? And what shouldn't we?
 
 * Digital voter registration ads to grow the electorate
 * Video trackers to force candidate transparency
 * No robocalls
 * State-of-the-art digital canvassing and field tools
 * No negative ads
 * Whatever helps us win
 
Choose what you think is most important from the tactical options on the right. Then make a pledge, and we'll use your input in crafting our campaign to take back our democracy.  Remember, because it's kickstarted, we only keep your money if we reach our goal.
